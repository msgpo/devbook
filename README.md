# Mysterium developer's handbook

The goal of the devbook is to improve development efficiency. It serves 2 purposes: 

1. align developers on development/collaboration practices
2. smoothen onboarding for the newcomers

All practices in the devbook are meant to serve as guidelines, rather than rules.  
There will always be exceptions to the guidelines. 
However, if exceptions occur frequently, consider adjusting guidelines (by creating a PR) to keep them up-to-date.

### [Commit messages](#commit-messages)

We use widely established conventions for idiomatic Git commit messages:

- Use imperative mood in the subject line.  

  A properly formed Git commit subject line should always be able to complete the following sentence:  
  If applied, this commit will _**your subject line here**_
- Separate subject from body with a blank line
- Limit the subject line to a single, short sentence
- Capitalize the subject line
- Do not end the subject line with a period
- Use the body to explain _what_ and _why_ vs. _how_.  
- Wrap the body at 72 characters
