## Preamble

The goal of the devbook improve development efficiency. It serves 2 purposes: 

1. align developers on development/collaboration practices
2. smoothen onboarding for the newcomers

All practices in the devbook are meant to serve as guidelines, rather than rules.  
There will always be exceptions to the guidelines. 
However, if exceptions occur frequently, consider adjusting guidelines (by creating a PR) to keep them up-to-date.
